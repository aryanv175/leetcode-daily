# 2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations

Problem Statement: You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.

In one operation:

choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length,
increase your score by nums[i], and
replace nums[i] with ceil(nums[i] / 3).
Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly k operations.

The ceiling function ceil(val) is the least integer greater than or equal to val.
